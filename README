Notes about using the library on different systems:
---------------------------------------------------

Linux:

Should work when ran as root without problems.

Windows:

Requires TAP-Win32 driver installed, can be downloaded for example from
http://www.sixxs.net/tools/aiccu/ location. The version tap901 is tested and
recommended.

Mac OS X:

Requires TunTap driver for the Mac OS X system. Can be downloaded from
http://tuntaposx.sourceforge.net/ location.

FreeBSD:

Requires that the TAP driver is loaded to the system. This can usually be done
by running the command "kldload if_tap" as root.

OpenBSD:

Starting from OpenBSD 3.5, tun devices are dynamically created at boot time. So
if you want to for example create device "tun0", run the command "touch
/etc/hostname.tun0" as root and reboot the system.

Solaris:

Requires that TAP driver is installed to the system. It can be downloaded from
http://www.whiteboard.ne.jp/~admin2/tuntap/ or installed using pkg-get with the
command "pkg-get install tap".
